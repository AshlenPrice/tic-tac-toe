## Overview
 For the first project I envision creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player can log in to play a game and view game stats.
  A player doens't have to sign in to play a game. The first player starts as X and alternates to O unti either one wins.

## Journey
This was a chanllenging, long but fullfilling journey. The hardest part of my project overall was building the engine and doing the AJAX calls. I wanted to make a game my son could play and I did that, so that makes me happy. I had issues with requireing files in the engine only to realize that I needed to call them in the constructor object. I want to do better planing and time management in the next project. I think that would help me inmmensely.
